# Building a GraphQL API Pt. 1
Not sure what will go here yet.


## Prerequisites
* GraphQL and GraphiQL
* Understanding how to read and write GraphQL Queries
* Apollo Client

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:
* Be able to setup an Apollo server
* Understand how to utilize GraphQL Yoga
* Define Models and Schemas in GraphQL
* Define Query Method

### Apollo Server Setup

Will give a set by step walk through of setting up an Apollo server

Better preparation instructions may be found as
[snippets](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/instructors/tree/master/snippets).


### What is GraphQL Yoga
Give a brief overview of GraphQL Yoga, how to install, and utilize it.

Possible `I Do`, `You Do`


## Models and Schemas in GraphQL
Give a brief review on what a Schema/Model is. Refer back to past examples; possibly Mongoose.

This section of the lesson will introduce students to:
1. Defining a Schema
2. Defining Query Method
3. Sending Queries

### Defining a Schema
* `I Do`, `We Do` section where we walk students through defining a GraphQL Schema.

### Defining Query Method
* `I Do`, `We Do` section where we walk students through defining query methods.

### Sending Queries
* Review with students how to then send a query to their newly create query methods

## Lab: Write a Lab
Plan to use [Challenge Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-dc-instructors/homework-template)
Ideas for first lab:
  1. Provide students a link to a free public GraphQL API and have them query for specific data based on provided prompts.
  2. Provide students a link to a free public GraphqL API and matching REST API and have them query both APIs for the same data based on provided prompts.
      * This will allow then to see the benefits of querying a GraphQL API vs a REST API.
  3. Open to suggestions.

## Homework: Write a Homework
Plan to use [Challenge Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-dc-instructors/homework-template)

Ideas for first Homework:
1. Not sure if I should mimic lesson here? Would really love feedback on what Zakk might like to see here.
