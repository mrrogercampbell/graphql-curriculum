# What is GraphQL?

 Use this section to answer the question: "Why am I learning this?".

GraphQL is a new API standard that was developed and open-sourced by Facebook with the intent to be a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST.

Some consider GraphQL a database technology but this is incorrect, it is a **query language** for APIs.

GraphQL utilizes **declarative data fetching**, this allows a client to specify the exact data it wants from an API. Instead of utilizing multiple endpoints that all return static data structures, a GraphQL server only exposes a single endpoint and responds with the exact data the client is requesting.

## Prerequisites
* Basic Understanding of JavaScript:
  * Syntax
  * Data Types
  * Functions and Methods

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

* Explain the difference between:
  * REST & GraphQL
  * GraphQL and GraphiQL
* Be able to read and write GraphQL queries

## Preparation

1. Fork and clone this repository.
   [FAQ](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
1. Create a new branch, `training`, for your work.
1. Checkout to the `training` branch.
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.

Better preparation instructions may be found as
[snippets](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/instructors/tree/master/snippets).

It's a good idea to have students do these steps while you're writing objectives
on the whiteboard.

## REST vs GraphQL
Give a brief overview of the differences between REST and GraphQL.

This section will be a high level overview.

### REST APIs
Will explain in detail what REST API are and how they traditionally function.

Will highlight the benefits and flaws to working with one.

? As for framing of this section are we expecting students to have prior knowledge of REST APIs?
  ?Meaning have we already taught them REST?

#### Interacting with a REST API - We Do
Will have students either
1. Clone down a REST API repo and interact with it.
2. Provide a link to a REST API documentation and have students interact with it that way.

Would love feedback on what you suggest or if this section even makes sense to have.


### GraphQL APIs
Will explain in detail what a GraphQL API is and how they traditionally function.

Will highlight the benefits and flaws to working with one.

#### Interacting with a GraphQL API via GraphiQL - We Do
Will have students either
1. Clone down a GraphQL API repo and interact with it.
2. Provide a link to a GraphQL API documentation and have students interact with it that way.

Would love feedback on what you suggest or if this section even makes sense to have.

This section will also explain to student what GraphiQL is and how it functions

#### GraphQL Queries
This sections will explain GraphQL queries.
This will be accomplished by demoing how to write queries, I plan to utilize whichever method is decided on above to accomplish this task; ie show students how to write queries with either a free public GraphQL API or one we have them clone down.

## Lab: Write a Lab
Plan to use [Challenge Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-dc-instructors/homework-template)
Ideas for first lab:
  1. Provide students a link to a free public GraphQL API and have them query for specific data based on provided prompts.
  2. Provide students a link to a free public GraphqL API and matching REST API and have them query both APIs for the same data based on provided prompts.
      * This will allow then to see the benefits of querying a GraphQL API vs a REST API.
  3. Open to suggestions.

## Homework: Write a Homework
Plan to use [Challenge Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-dc-instructors/homework-template)

Ideas for first Homework:
1. Not sure if I should mimic lesson here? Would really love feedback on what Zakk might like to see here.

## Additional Resources

- Any useful links should be included in the talk material where the link is
  first referenced.
- Additional links for further study or exploration are appropriate in this
  section.
- Links to important parts of documentation not covered during the talk, or
  tools tangentially used but not part of the focus of the talk, are also
  appropriate.
