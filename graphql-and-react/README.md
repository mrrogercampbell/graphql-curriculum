# Intro Section
Not sure what will go here yet.


## Prerequisites
* GraphQL and GraphiQL
* Understanding of how to read and write GraphQL Queries

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:
* Setup Apollo Client within a React Application
* Fetch Data from a GraphQL API
* Render Fetched Data from a GraphQL API via React Components

## Installing Apollo Client

Will give a set by step walk through of install Apollo client and all sub-dependencies.

For now I think we will use:
1. Apollo Client
2. Parcel

Better preparation instructions may be found as
[snippets](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/instructors/tree/master/snippets).

### What is Parcel (and or any other sub-dependencies)
This will be a quick and high level section explain what the intended purposes of the sub-dependencies are.

### What is Apollo
Give a brief overview of Apollo and how it allows you to handle fetching and rendering GraphQL within a React application.

This section will be a high level overview.


## Interacting with GraphQL Data in React
This section of the lesson will introduce students to:
1. Performing API Calls With Apollo Client
2. Rendering Fetched GraphQL Data in React
3. GraphQL Variables

### Performing API Calls With Apollo Client
* `I Do`, `We Do` section where we walk students through performing API calls to GraphQL endpoint.
* Plan to use a free public GraphQL API.

### Rendering Fetched GraphQL Data in React
* `I Do`, `We Do` section where show students how to render fetched GraphQL data via React Components.

## GraphQL Variables
Will explain GraphQL variables and how they provide a better way to set up dynamic values in operations

* This section will have a `I Do` and `We Do`

## Lab: Write a Lab
Plan to use [Challenge Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-dc-instructors/homework-template)
Ideas for first lab:
  1. Provide students a link to a free public GraphQL API and have them query for specific data based on provided prompts.
  2. Provide students a link to a free public GraphqL API and matching REST API and have them query both APIs for the same data based on provided prompts.
      * This will allow then to see the benefits of querying a GraphQL API vs a REST API.
  3. Open to suggestions.

## Homework: Write a Homework
Plan to use [Challenge Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-dc-instructors/homework-template)

Ideas for first Homework:
1. Not sure if I should mimic lesson here? Would really love feedback on what Zakk might like to see here.

## Additional Resources

- Any useful links should be included in the talk material where the link is first referenced.
- Additional links for further study or exploration are appropriate in this section.
- Links to important parts of documentation not covered during the talk, or tools tangentially used but not part of the focus of the talk, are also appropriate.
