# Intro Section
Not sure what will go here yet.


## Prerequisites
* GraphQL and GraphiQL
* Understanding how to read and write GraphQL Queries
* Be able to describe what an Apollo Client is and how to setup a server utilizing it
* Define GraphQL Models and Schemas
* Define Query Method

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:
* Define Advance GraphQL Query Methods
* Instantiate Full CRUD in a GraphQL API
* Perform CRUD queries to a GraphQL API

## CRUD within GraphQL

Give a brief review of what CRUD is.

### Create
`I Do`, `You Do`  Walk student through creating Create functionality inside of a GraphQL API

### Performing Create Queries
`I Do`, `You Do` Walk student through performing Create queries to a GraphQL API

### Read
`I Do`, `You Do`  Walk student through creating Read functionality inside of a GraphQL API

### Performing Read Queries
`I Do`, `You Do` Walk student through performing Read queries to a GraphQL API

### Update
`I Do`, `You Do`  Walk student through creating Update functionality inside of a GraphQL API

### Performing Update Queries
`I Do`, `You Do` Walk student through performing Update queries to a GraphQL API

### Delete
`I Do`, `You Do`  Walk student through creating Delete functionality inside of a GraphQL API

### Performing Delete Queries
`I Do`, `You Do` Walk student through performing Delete queries to a GraphQL API

## Advance Queries
Not sure what will go here yet. Still learning about advance queries and trying to decide which will be best to show students. 

## Lab: Write a Lab
Plan to use [Challenge Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-dc-instructors/homework-template)
Ideas for first lab:
  1. Provide students a link to a free public GraphQL API and have them query for specific data based on provided prompts.
  2. Provide students a link to a free public GraphqL API and matching REST API and have them query both APIs for the same data based on provided prompts.
      * This will allow then to see the benefits of querying a GraphQL API vs a REST API.
  3. Open to suggestions.

## Homework: Write a Homework
Plan to use [Challenge Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-dc-instructors/homework-template)

Ideas for first Homework:
1. Not sure if I should mimic lesson here? Would really love feedback on what Zakk might like to see here.
